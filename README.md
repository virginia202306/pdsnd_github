### Bike share data

### Description
In this project, we are going to utilize Python and descriptive statistics concepts to explore data associated with bike share systems for three big cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
We will use python to answer some interesting basic statistical questions about the data. Moreover, we will provide a user interactive experience in the terminal to ask about and represent these statistics.

It is a system that allows you to rent bikes for a reasonable amount of money. In this system, you can take the bike from one point (station) and then return it to another point (another station) _ that belongs to the system of course after the end of your trip or maybe return to the same starting point again, it depends on the system itself.
In the past years, the bicycle sharing system has developed and spread widely in many cities of the world. As we mentioned before, in this project we will deal specifically with three major cities, Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
